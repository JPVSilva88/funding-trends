## Funding Trends

**What is it?**

Funding Trends helps people understand grant-making data from [360Giving](http://www.threesixtygiving.com) in a new and exciting way. Users can zoom out on the data to see the overall funding trends and then zoom in to take a closer look at dedicated dashboards for each funder.

It uses data from 360Giving’s [GrantNav](http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/), as well as Charity Commission data from the [CharityBase](https://charitybase.uk/) database.

**Who can it help?**

- Funders
  * _Undertake strategic reviews_: See how your funding has changed over the years and how your foundation compares to others
  * _Communicate your data_: Use your dedicated dashboard to share key statistics about your giving with trustees, staff and recipients

- Charities or other user-led organisations
  * _Research new funding sources_: Find out more about potential funding prospects and their approach to grant-making
  * _Learn more about your current funders_: See how they compare to other funders and view other organisations that are also funded

- Researchers
  * _Understand common practice among funders_: Examine topics such as popular focus themes, number of recipients and size of grants
  * _Uncover new patterns_: Discover changes in grant-making over the years at the overall and individual level

**What are the liminations of this data?**

There are limitations in this data that you should keep in mind when researching foundations and making conclusions from the data:

1. Not all funders are included: It only includes funders that have submitted their data to the 360Giving before July 2018—find out how to submit your foundation’s data here.
   
   _For example: major UK funder Garfield Weston Foundation is not included._
2. Funding data does not cover all years: This tool uses data over a five-year period from 2013 to 2017, but not all funders have submitted their data for this period.

   _For example: for the year 2017, the Wellcome Trust has so far only submitted data from 1 January to 30 September._
3. Theme data is incomplete: Funding recipients without a completed or matching Charity Commission field in the 360Giving Standard are excluded, alongside organisations that are not currently registered under the Charity Commission for England and Wales.
   
   _For example: theme data does not cover the organisations that are not registered as charities organisations among the Big Lottery Foundation's grant recipients._
4. Recipients can be listed under more than one category within each theme: This is because the tool uses the Charity Commission’s non-distinct approach to categorising charities under multiple themes.

   _For example: as NSPCC is categorised under both ‘education/training’ and ‘general charitable purposes’, it's funders are listed as supporting both categories._
